			<h1>Preventable Deaths Tracker</h2>
			<h3>A platform to explore concerns raised by coroners to prevent future deaths</h3>
			<p>Under <a href='https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1984/552/article/43/made'>The Coroners Rule 1984</a>, coroners in England and Wales have a duty to report and communicate a death when the coroner believes that action should be taken to prevent similar deaths. In 2013, these reports, named Prevent Future Deaths or PFDs, became mandated under Paragraph 7 of Schedule 5 of <a href='https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/schedule/5'>The Coroners and Justice Act 2009</a>, and regulations 28 and 29 of <a href='https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/1629/part/7/made'>The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013</a>. Under these regulations, parties that receive a PFD report are required to respond to the coroner within <b>56 days</b> of receiving the report, to outline actions taken or proposed that address the coronerâ€™s concerns. Many recognise the important lessons outlined by coroners in PFDs, but concerns have been raised regarding the lack of wider communication of these lessons, and insufficient monitoring of the statutory requirement of responding to PFDs and taking action. We have created this website - <b>the Preventable Deaths Tracker</b> - to collate and display the data from PFDs in a visual, filterable, and searchable format that others can use. We have also launched the <a href='https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2020/11/24/bmjebm-2020-111567'>Coroners' Concerns to Prevent Harms</a> series in BMJ Evidence Based Medicine to disseminate important lessons that serve patient safety and prevent similar deaths.</p>

			<h3>Research & dissemination</h3>
			<p>We have a number of active research projects that are systematically analysing the database, including an assessment of suicides and deaths from opioids and medical events. We are writing case reports in <a href='https://ebm.bmj.com/'>BMJ Evidence Based Medicine</a> to highlight and communicate key lessons to prevent serious fatal and non-fatal harms. Articles published in the series, include:</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
         			<li>harms from ingesting alcohol-based hand sanisiter, <a href='https://ebm.bmj.com/content/26/2/65'>available here</a>. This article was selected for press-release by <a href='https://www.bmj.com/'>The BMJ</a> and was picked up by 14 news outlets, including the <a href='https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9005137/Swallowing-alcohol-based-hand-sanitiser-kill.html'>Daily Mail</a>, <a href='https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/12/01/experts-call-warnings-dangers-swallowing-hand-sanitiser-poisonings/amp/'>The Telegraph</a>, BBC Radio Oxford, and BBC Radio 5 Live Saturday Breakfast</li>

			<h3>The database</h3>
			<p>Data in the table below were obtained from the <a href='https://www.judiciary.uk/subject/prevention-of-future-deaths/'>Courts and Tribunals Judiciary Website</a>. To collate the data, we ran a web scrape, which is available in our <a href="https://github.com/georgiarichards/georgiarichards.github.io/tree/master/data">GitHub repository</a>. We have written about the web scrape in <i>Nature</i>, <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02558-0'>"How we learnt to stop worrying and love web scraping".</a></p>
