# Some summary statistics

As of 12/09/2021, the judiciary
has uploaded 3709
reports. 
1416
of them are unresponded to.
2293 
of them have received at least one response. And
1368
have received the expected number of responses or more.

The expected number of responses is calculated by finding the number
of recipients of a report. In some cases, interested parties not
initially named as respondents also respond. Due to an absence of
machine-readable data, it is difficult to devise more informative schemas
that remain robust.
