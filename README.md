# Preventable Deaths Tracker

This repository contains the code and data for running the Preventable Deaths Tracker: http://preventabledeathstracker.net

## Data

The data is taken from: https://www.judiciary.uk/subject/prevention-of-future-deaths/ 

To capture the data, we run a web scraper which is available in the `data` folder. 

The names of the deceased have been processed by Georgia Richards due to the sensitive nature of the data.  


## Research & dissemination 

We are working on a number of research projects with this data including an analysis of deaths from opioids, suicides and cardiovascular events.

We wrote about the data collection method, web scraping, in *Nature* available here: ["How we learnt to stop worrying and love web scraping"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02558-0)

We wrote an editorial in BMJ Evidence Based Medicine to launch the series, [Coroners' Concerns to Prevent Harms](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2021/01/10/bmjebm-2020-111567), which will share a case report each month from the database to highlight key lessons to prevent serious non-fatal and fatal harms. 

Our first case report was published on December 01, 2020: [Alcohol-based hand sanitisers: a warning to mitigate future poisonings and deaths](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2020/12/02/bmjebm-2020-111568)
