# Preventable Deaths Tracker

This repository contains the code and data for running the Preventable Deaths Tracker: http://preventabledeathstracker.net

## Data

The data is taken from the [Courts and Tribunals Judiciary website](https://www.judiciary.uk/subject/prevention-of-future-deaths/)

To capture the data, we run a web scraper which is available in the `data` folder. 

The names of the deceased have been processed by Georgia Richards due to the sensitive nature of the data.  


## Research & dissemination 

We are working on a number of research projects with this data including an analysis of deaths from [SARS-CoV-2](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.15.21260589v1), [opioids](https://osf.io/ecz4r/), [suicides](https://osf.io/ad4up/), and [anticoagulants and cardiovascular disease](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.28.21256272v1).

We wrote about the data collection method, web scraping, in *Nature* available here: ["How we learnt to stop worrying and love web scraping"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02558-0)

We wrote an editorial in BMJ Evidence Based Medicine to launch the series, [Coroners' Concerns to Prevent Harms](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2021/01/10/bmjebm-2020-111567), which will share a case report each month from the database to highlight key lessons to prevent serious non-fatal and fatal harms. The published articles in the series, include:
* harms from ingesting [alcohol-based hand sanisiter](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/26/2/65)
* harms from undiagnosed and untreated adverse drug reactions from [diclofenac in adolescents](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2021/02/09/bmjebm-2020-111640)
* harms from [repeated prescriptions of tramadol](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2021/03/11/bmjebm-2020-111661)
