# Preventable Deaths Tracker

This repository contains the code and data for running the Preventable Deaths Tracker: http://preventabledeathstracker.net 

## Data

The data is taken from: https://www.judiciary.uk/subject/prevention-of-future-deaths/ 

To capture the data, we run a web scraper which is available in the `notebooks` folder. 

The names of the deceased have been processed by Georgia Richards due to the sensitive nature of the data.  


## Research & dissemination 

We are working on a number of research projects with this data including an analysis of deaths from opioids, suicides and cardiovascular events.

We wrote about the web scrape to collect the data in *Nature* available here: ["How we learnt to stop worrying and low web scraping"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02558-0)

We write a monthly case report in [BMJ Evidence Based Medicine](https://ebm.bmj.com/) to highlight key lessons to prevent serious non-fatal and fatal harms.
